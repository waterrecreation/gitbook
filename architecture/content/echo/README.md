# Echo

After we knowing everything can be embedded into content, then content posted by another one can be embedded too.

From the figure we see B fetches Aâ€™s content and embeds it into his own content and sends it to a community whatever he wants, 1 drip is awarded to B. Then C sees this content, he likes or commented on the content, and C gets 0.2 or 1 drip. And for A and B, the default drip royalty is 5% for A. So it is 0.05 for A and 0.95 for B if C commented.
