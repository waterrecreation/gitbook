# Drips

Drips(issued by the [Drip Contract](https://github.com/beepopula/Drip-contract)), are non-transferable fungible tokens, which can be used to prove participation and measure valuable contributions, and also be used for accessing gated content. If a user wants to gain its drips, it must do actions in a community, and then the community can prove to Drip Contract that it has these contributions and issue drips to this user. In addition, drips are not accumulated by all communities, they are separated.
