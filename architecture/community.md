# Community

[Community](https://github.com/beepopula/community) is a core concept in Popula. It is probably the most important use case for bridging the protocol layer and the application layer. In the beginning, a community is an independent contract that is deployed from a [community factory](https://github.com/beepopula/community-genesis). Then the community owner can post or manage the community.
